// comparison //

/* We know many comparison operators from maths.

In JavaScript they are written like this:

Greater/less than: a > b, a < b.
Greater/less than or equals: a >= b, a <= b.
Equals: a == b, please note the double equality sign == means the equality test, while a single one a = b means an assignment.
Not equals: In maths the notation is ≠, but in JavaScript it’s written as a != b.

All comparison operators return a boolean value:

true – means “yes”, “correct” or “the truth”.
false – means “no”, “wrong” or “not the truth”.

//alert(2 > 1); this of course will return back true as 2 is bigger than 1.
//alert(2 == 1); this will return back false as 2 is not equal to 1.
//alert(2 != 1); this will return back truse because 2 and 1 are obviously not the same.

let result = 5 > 1;
// alert(`${result} because 5 is obviously greater than 1 ... duh`); the result of is 5 greater than one is stored in a variable called result and then displayed using the alert thing.
